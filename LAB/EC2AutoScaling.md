Efficient and Resilient Workloads with Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling



This workshop is designed to get you familiar with the concepts and best practices for effectively and efficiently scaling Amazon EC2 capacity using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and its features, including predictive scaling and warm pools.

In this workshop you will assume the role of a Cloud Architect tasked with finding an efficient Auto Scaling solution for a sample application. You have been provided with a monolithic application which receives cyclical traffic; high usage during regular business hours and low usage during evenings and weekends. The application takes a long time (over 10 minutes) to initialize, causing a noticeable latency impact on application performance when scaling out.

In this workshop you will conduct exercises to find the correct Auto Scaling solution to ensure your application is ready in minimal time and scales quickly by launching capacity in advance of forecasted load without the need to overprovision.

Time and Cost
The estimated time for completing the workshop is 60-90 minutes and cost of running this workshop is less than $10 USD.

Prerequisites
This is an L300 workshop, we expect readers to be familiar with the concepts below

Amazon EC2 
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups 
AWS CloudWatch metrics for EC2 .
For those unfamiliar with these concepts, the lab should provide enough context to understand what's happening, and at an AWS event there should be staff nearby to help if you get stuck
