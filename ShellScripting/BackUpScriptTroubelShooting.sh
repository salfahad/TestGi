# From CLI Doc
When passed with the parameter --recursive, the following cp
command recursively copies all files under a specified directory
to a specified bucket 

# From GitHub

https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/8190

So --recursive is only intended for use under a specified directory or
prefix and not for single files. I don't think the cp 
command will support --recursive for single files
as that's not its intended use. But I agree that 
the current behavior is a confusing edge case. 
I couldn't find any other reports of this so 
I don't think it's a commonly encountered problem, 
but I think the command should error out or at 
least provide a warning when attempting to use
 --recursive for a single file. 
 Thanks again for reporting this issue â€” I will leave it open 
 for tracking.
